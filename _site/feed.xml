It was my first trip to the land of Mickey. Even though I was a self-conscious teenager and terrified of being seen in public with my parents, I was enamoured and mesmerized by the utopian setting that Disney World is famous for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#tldnr&quot;&gt;TL;DNR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father was a keen photographer. So, he always supplied us some kind of point-and-shoot film camera to play with on our family vacations. One of the first things I remember seeing at the &lt;em&gt;happiest place on earth&lt;/em&gt; (after the long queue at the entrance) was a sign similar to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://balistreetphotographer.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/kodak_picture_spot_sign_disney.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Kodak picture spot at Walt Disney World&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Above&lt;/strong&gt;: Following these instructions wouldn’t be called street photography. But, this photograph of the sign in the foreground and the tourist taking a photo in the middle-ground follows the spirit of street photography. Image from Flickr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent segue to describe the &lt;strong&gt;opposite&lt;/strong&gt; of what street photography is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-else-is-not-street-photography&quot;&gt;What else is not street photography?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Studio portraits&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nature landscapes and macro&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Photos of your pet dog and cat&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fashion photography&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Abstract &amp;amp; fine art photography&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Still life&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wedding photography&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sports&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Food&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Urban exploration, city scapes, and architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Your eye must see a composition or an expression that life itself offers you, and you must know with intuition when to click the camera.

~Henri Cartier-Bresson (father of modern photojournalism)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-philosophy-of-street-photography&quot;&gt;The Philosophy of Street Photography&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, street photography resembles more of a philosophy than a technique. I’ve tried to express the philosophy in the mission statement for Bali Street Photographer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bali-street-photographers-mission-statement&quot;&gt;Bali Street Photographer’s Mission Statement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see rather than look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create rather than take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To explore rather than visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To connect rather than separate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing missing is to practice the above with a camera in hand. Sure, we can go at length talking abut technique: taking stridebys, layering compositions, being candid, approaching strangers, and random street portraits. I feel that these concepts fall into place more naturally when capturing HCB‘s (Henri Cartier-Bresson) decisive moment is cultivated intrinsically. I.e., intuitively feeling when to click–which is the opposite of following a sign that says, “Take your photograph here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-rules-of-street-photography&quot;&gt;The “Rules” of Street Photography&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pop-quiz! According to my philosophy, does a candid photo of someone at the beach with no street in sight count as street photography? Yes! Ironically it does. Clear as mud?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, if you need some (shall we say) structure, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lomography.com/about/the-ten-golden-rules&quot;&gt;Lomography’s 10 Golden Rules&lt;/a&gt; is the best collection of street photography guidelines I’ve seen compiled in one place. Pay extra careful attention to rule #10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Above&lt;/strong&gt;: What one sees at a Balinese wedding. Candid street portrait of a Balinese bride with a chicken sitting above her head. Taken on 35mm film with an unexpected surprise of double exposure going on in the bottom part of the frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head over to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://balistreetphotographer.wordpress.com/portfolio/jalan-jalan/&quot;&gt;Jalan Jalan photo gallery&lt;/a&gt; for more street photography examples and inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;tldnr&quot; id=&quot;tldnr&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tldnr&quot;&gt;TL;DNR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me street photography is an attempt to capture random acts of candidness. It’s a human condition style of photography that tries to portray people in everyday life situations where everyone might be looking but not really seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
