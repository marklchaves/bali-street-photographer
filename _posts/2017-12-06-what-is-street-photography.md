Sometime in the 1970s, my parents took my brothers and me to **Walt Disney World** in Orlando, Florida. It was my first trip to the land of Mickey. Even though I was a self-conscious teenager and terrified of being seen in public with my parents, I was enamoured and mesmerized by the utopian setting that Disney World is famous for.

[TL;DR](#tldr)

My father was a keen photographer. So, he always supplied us some kind of point-and-shoot film camera to play with on our family vacations. One of the first things I remember seeing at the _happiest place on earth_ (after the long queue at the entrance) was a sign similar to this.

**Above**: Following these instructions wouldn't be called street photography. But, this photograph of the sign in the foreground and the tourist taking a photo in the middle-ground follows the spirit of street photography. Image from Flickr.

This is an excellent segue to describe the **opposite** of what street photography is.

## What else is not street photography?

## The Philosophy of Street Photography

For me, street photography resembles more of a philosophy than a technique. I’ve tried to express the philosophy in the mission statement for Bali Street Photographer.

### Bali Street Photographer's Mission Statement 

To see rather than look. 

To create rather than take. 

To explore rather than visit. 

To connect rather than separate.

The only thing missing is to practise the above with a camera in hand. Sure, we can go at length talking abut technique: taking stridebys, layering compositions, being candid, approaching strangers, and random street portraits. 

I think that street photography concepts fall into place naturally when practising HCB‘s (Henri Cartier-Bresson) decisive moment. I.e., It's better to intuitively feel when to click&nbsp;which is the opposite of following a sign that says, “Take your photograph here.”

## The “Rules” of Street Photography

Pop-quiz! According to my philosophy, does a candid photo of someone at the beach with no street in sight count as street photography? Yes! Ironically it does. Clear as mud?

OK, if you need some (shall we say) structure, [Lomography’s 10 Golden Rules](https://www.lomography.com/about/the-ten-golden-rules) is the best collection of street photography guidelines I’ve seen compiled in one place. Pay extra careful attention to rule #10.

Head over to the [Jalan Jalan photo gallery](https://balistreetphotographer.wordpress.com/portfolio/jalan-jalan/) for more street photography examples and inspiration.

## TL;DR

For me street photography is an attempt to capture random acts of candidness. It’s a human condition style of photography that tries to portray people in everyday life situations where everyone might be looking but not really seeing.
